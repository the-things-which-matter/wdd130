       <h1>Youtube Shorts</h1>
       <p class="ruth">Youtube Shorts are a short form content videos of a maximum of one minute, the video can be less that that but not more than that. They are similar to the short form content on tiktok and instagrame. This content type is being pushed on more and youtube is promoting even new creator and as a matter of fact, you can make videos of almost everything. You can monenetize or get more from your youtube shorts but as to everything in life, there are requirements for you to start making money. For youtibe shorts, you need to have a minimum of 1000 subscribers to your channel and 3 Million public watch views. Now let these numbers not scare you because youtbe shorts are often pushed out and you will most likely get a minmum of  thousands of views on each video and if you have more videos, you shoud be able to reach these requirements in no time and on addition, we are here to help.
