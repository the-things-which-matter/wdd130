        <h1>Passive Income</h1>
        <p>There are a few things which may be as relieving, asuring and great than having passive income. Pasive income is basically a system of money coming in even with no or atleast less effort put in, in this  case you will not make money like a daily 9-5 job, ehat you will need to do is to invest in form of a kind of content that people will be willing to watch and as they watch it, you will be receiving money. It is literally making money as you sleep. It could also be a good retirement plan for those who feel they need one. Part-time passive income as it sounds is basically spending half or less the time you have to invest in youtube and you definately get good money although, you may get less thatn the  one doing youtube as a full-time job. the advantage of being a part-tme youtuber is that you still have more time to do other things on the sides like  a side business.  Being a full-time youtuber is the exact opposite where you invest more time and focus than a partime youtuber, it is good because you earn more money and have more time to focus on your youtube business. On the other hand, it may be hard for you to have a side job as it may ocupy a good amount of time  in the investment stage.</p>
