All these hange or use one or a combination of the following; These ten categories include; Levitation, Vanish, Production, Transformation, Transposition, Penetration, Restoration, Escape, Teleportation and Prediction. There ae two main ways to go about it, eaither you alraedy know what you want forexample card magic and you decide to start with that directly or you don't know where to start from and start from anywhere and learn as much magic as possible and then decide what you want to choose and focus on. It is recommende that you focud on some type of magic because focus can bring the most out of you in that particular field. Although this may be encourange, it is still okay if one can decide to become a generalized magician and can perform in diffrent areas. The categories are explained simply as follows; levitation is the act magic object fly in air, Vanishing is when when and object is made to disappear during the performance, Production is when an object id made to apear out of thin air, Transformation is where an object is changed into another, Transposition is when object the positions of the objects are interchanged, Penetration is when something is made to enter inside something else, Escape is when and object or a person is made to leave an otherwise impossible situation or place, Telepotation is when an object or person is made to move quickly from one place to another, Prediction is when you guess correctly what will happen way before it happens.
